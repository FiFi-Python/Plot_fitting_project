Welcome to Plot Image Fitter's technical documentation!

========================================================
**Plot Image Fitter** is a university project made by me (Adam Strach)
and my friend Rados≈Çaw Kluczewski. The resulting programme is meant to be
able to rotate any plot image to its natural horizontal position and
extract data points from an image. The code can be found on Github
<https://github.com/FiFi-Python/Plot_fitting>

.. note::

   This project is just a basic version made for a university class.
   Problems may occur while using it and fixes may not come, but you
   are welcome to try to solve them, or notify us by writing to
