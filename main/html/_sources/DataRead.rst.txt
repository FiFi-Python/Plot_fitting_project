DataRead
=========


Packages
--------
We are using:

NumPy <https://numpy.org/>

OpenCv <https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html>

math <https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html>.

Convertion to gray and masking
------------------------------
Image is converted to gray scale and then using OpenCv bitwise_and <https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d0/d86/tutorial_py_image_arithmetics.html>,
program show only points from certain gray scale.


Coordinates of data points
--------------------------
Then remaining points coordinates are then saved using OpenCv findNonZero, but points
close to axes are excluded.
Then the rotated image is ploted with blue dotes in position of saved coordinates.
