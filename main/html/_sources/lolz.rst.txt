Introductory description
========================

The main program is Axis_looker.py with axillary rotate_bound.py. The secondary
program for further analysis is data_read.py.

**Axis_looker** takes as an argument path to an image and returns array
of four arrays each containing image, x coordinate of central point of
plot, y coordinate of center of plot. The programme finds all lines
(using Hough lines transformation) on the image and selects
the longest perpendicular as an axis then propagates the image and found axes to
rotate_bound which output of rotated images is then returned.

**Rotate_bound** find crossing points of axes and angle of rotation from vertical
-horizontal position. The crossing point of axes is a point around which the image
is then rotated using an appropriate rotation matrix. Rotate_bound returns
an array of four arrays containing rotated images and central points
(with already rotated coordinates).

**data_read** takes 3 arguments image, x and y coordinates of crossing point
of axes and returns image and coordinates of plot function points. Program convert copy of image to gray scale then masks all points
in certain gray scale (get rid of bright color points). Then reads all
remaining points position apart of points around axes. Later it dots
original image at all found points blue then return array consisting
of image and list of points of the plot.
